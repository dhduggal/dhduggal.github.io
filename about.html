            <h1>About Me</h1> 
            <div id="about_paragraph">
                <p>
                    I am a 4th year student at the University of California San Diego pursing a major in Computer Science and minor in Economics.
                    At this time I am actively searching for full time work opportunities starting June 2020. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Since I was a young child I have been interested in computers and software. I always found them intriguing.
                    When the time came to decide on a major, it was easy pickings. Now I am at a point in my life where once again I need to further
                    my learning by working in an organization that will help me further my love for computers and software. Currently my interests in the
                    field of Computer Science lie in Machine Learning/AI, Security, Data Science and Software Engineering
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However it wasn't just computers that fascinated me. Sports, music and gaming are also passions of mine. From the age of 6 I 
                    have been playing the Tabla (classical Indian Drum) and Tennis almost every week without any sign of me stopping in sight. Gaming
                    was a passion that I discovered at slightly later age (towards the end of high school), however these three activities insure that 
                    I have the ability to entertain myself, pull my self out of a bad mood and ensure that I am always trying to figure out something new
                    in a field that is not computer science related, creating a great balance between my academic/professional and personal life.
