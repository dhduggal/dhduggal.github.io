                <h3>DMI Finance - Summer 2019</h3>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 2019, I worked at DMI Finance in New Delhi. Here I created credit risk models to predict the probability of
                    default for 'New to Credit' customers for partners ZestMoney and Samsung. These models were created using <em><strong>Python
                    ,Scikit-Learn, SQL and Athena(Amazon Serverless Interactive Query Service)</strong></em>. 
                    During my time at DMI, I was responsible for extracting and cleaning data, Visualizing and treating data for outliers and null values,
                    dealing with an imbalanced dataset (using SMOTE oversampling), creating a gradient boost and logistic regression model in order to
                    to minimize decile based risk. During my time here I learnt a great deal about Machine Learning, Fin-Tech Companies and common API's of
                    relational database.

                <h3>Alchemy X- Spring & Summer 2018</h3>
                <p>
                    Alchemy was an on-campus startup (in San Diego, California) that I worked at alongside classes during spring and summer quarters
                    in 2018. While working at Alchemy I created <em><strong>Python</strong></em> scripts to scrape data from Instagram and crawl
                    through different users and hashtags using modules <em><strong>Requests & BS4</strong></em>. From the data that was collected, I 
                    created a graph of users/hashtags that are similar with the end goal of using the graph to provide customers with access to pages with
                    similar content and smaller following for advertising purposes (mainly to advertise to a smaller group of people at lower costs). As 
                    a side project during my time here I also created an automated DM'ing service, that broadcasted messages to large groups of users on 
                    Instagram.

                <p>
                    In summer quarter of first year I worked in the data analysis and customer care department at Accenture for client, Airtel
                    at their network operations center in Haryana. During this internship I was responsible for compiling data from call logs to check
                    how many complaints from corporate clients were being resolved within 24 hours of their logging. I helped in visualizing this data and
                    presenting it to upper management.
